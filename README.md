# Rocket_Elevators_Controllers
Contains the algorithm files for the elevator controllers for the New Rocket Elevator Solutions for both Residential and Commercial Offers.



************* Instruction for Residential Controllers *****************

Both JavaScript and Python programs have same structure. They include the following Classes:
	- class CallButton
	- class Column
	- class FloorRequestButton
	- class Elevator
	- lass Controller 
		The Class Controller contains all the methods (functions).
		The Column is also linked to the Controller. Therefore, the whole system 		of elevators will be stablished once a new instance of Controller is 			created.

All the Scenarios are already defined in separate functions.
	- Scenario1
	- Scenario2
	- Scenario3

But their CALLs, which are located at the end of program, are commented-out. To Run each Scenario simply remove the comment-out and run the program.
